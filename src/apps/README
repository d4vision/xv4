The application porgrams in this release are simple examples using different
library features that serve as initial templates for new programs.


vcp:      Example: Demo of use of frame and whole file i/o

vpix:     Example: Pixel operations 
          Features: multiple pixel types (macros), multiple frames
          Limits: only point (pixel) operations

vssum:    Example: operations on an image sequence.
          Features: manage a moving window of several image frames.
	  Features: temporal image sequence tools

vrcrossb: Example: spatial filter basic version of vrcross 
	  Feature: converts all pixel types to float for computation

vrcross:  Example: spatial filter vrcrossb just handles
	  Features: handles multiple pixel types using macros
	  Recommend: develop in vrcross style, update to vrcross

v3conv:   Example: spatial convoltion
	  Features: 3D image padding tools
	  Limits:   single kernel and byte or float images

vgen:     Example:  program to create a synthetic image
          Features: create image without an input image

vlmax:    Example:  Every image template 
	  Features: simple spatial filter, frame by frame  I/O 
	  Limits:   only byte pixels

vvec2:    Example: program that manipulates 2D vectors

vttxt:    Example: program to create a text file (with header)

v3df:     Example: Minimal program to manipulate 3D image structures

v3tpl:    Example: 3D-image manipulation
          Features: read 3D image (int) and 3D mask image (byte)
	  Features: 3D image tools
