System Requirements
===================

xv4Package can be built on the following platforms
- a CentOS/RHEL system, or
- a MacOS X system, or
- a MinGW installation on a Windows system

32-bit development environment for those platforms
(gcc, gmake, glibc)


Configuration
=============

A set of Makefiles is provided for the three platforms
with the names of Makefile.<platform>.
In the top directory copy your platform-specific
    Makefile.<platform>
as
    Makefile

To customize the installation edit the path settings
at the beginning of the file. If you want to change
any of those settings after the library has been compiled,
an invocation of
    make makefiles
is needed to propagate the new settings (followed by a new
compilation)



Compiling and Installing
========================
Invoking
    make
at the top level will make all the make files and build
the xv4Package library and executables
To install type
    make install



Compiling New Programs
======================

New programs to be added to a local installation can
be placed into the src/apps directory and appended
to the COUT variable definition. When make and
make install are invoked, they will be compiled
together with the default xv4Package programs.

After the installation of xv4Package new programs
can be developed and linked with the xv4Package
library inside a user's directory:
- create a directory where the development
  of the new programs will take place;
- copy the Makefile file that is in the subdirectory
  "devel" (at the top level of the installation path
  or in your locally defined location) into your
  new directory;
- type
      make <pgm-name>
  to compile the file <pgm-name>.c
